# Aviation Data Visualization Project 
This project processes air traffic and airport coordinates data using Python and plots the top ten destinations by PDEW for each airport. PDEW (passengers per day each way) is a metric that shows the number of passengers arriving at airports daily, which helps measure airport performance.

The data model used in this project is part of the [Aviation Data Visualization](https://aviation-data-visualization.netlify.app/) website.

## Features
* **Top Ten Destination PDEW Figure**: Visualizes the top ten destinations by PDEW for each airport.
* **Pivot Table Breakdown**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the results by airline.

## Example
* The example below shows the passengers arriving at SFO and ATL airports from January 2022 to November 2022:
